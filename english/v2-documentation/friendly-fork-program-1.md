### How do Forkonomics work?

Liquity V2 is published under a [Business Source License (BUSL)](https://github.com/liquity/bold/blob/main/contracts/LICENSE) the code is source-available, but any commercial use requires approval from Liquity AG.

So far, **20+ forks across multiple networks** have signed license agreements.

In return for the license, these teams commit to **bootstrap liquidity together** by allocating **\~5% of their token supply** for this shared purpose.

* 1.25% for Fork\_Stable/BOLD liquidity on their network
* 2.75% for BOLD user activity on mainnet
* 1% to Liquity AG

Forks allocate and distribute their incentives directly to users - this [Leaderboard](https://dune.com/liquity/v2-leaderboard) shows all recipients.

You can learn more about the program in this [blog post](https://www.liquity.org/blog/bootstrapping-liquity-v2).

### Resources

[**Forqty**](https://www.forqty.com/) provides an overview of all live and upcoming forks.

The [**V2 Leaderboard**](https://dune.com/liquity/v2-leaderboard) provides the current point allocations for mainnet.

The [**Yield Calculator**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PlXjxcSALf4QaDnu5GUgin4oVc5Wlw4Hs6RryxP_woU/edit?gid=0#gid=0) can be used to estimate your APR based on data you can enter.

### Program Rules

All friendly forks are responsible for communicating the details and implementation of their commitments, as well as distributing any program rewards.

The following points apply to all friendly forks:

* Each friendly fork is required to audit any changes made to the Liquity V2 codebase in their specific deployment.&#x20;
* Each friendly fork is minting its own respective stablecoin, not BOLD.&#x20;
* Each friendly fork has the right to implement mutability as it sees fit.
* Liquity AG is not in an ongoing partnership with any licensing entity.&#x20;
