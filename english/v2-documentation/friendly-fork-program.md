# Friendly Fork Program

###

### Program Background

Liquity V2 is published under a [Business Source License (BUSL)](https://github.com/liquity/bold/blob/main/contracts/LICENSE) such that, while the codebase is source available, any commercial deployment needs to be approved by Liquity AG.&#x20;

A number of friendly forks catering to blockchain networks and collateral asset types not supported for BOLD minting have thus entered into licensing agreements with Liquity AG. In exchange for the right to deploy their own stablecoins using Liquity V2 code, these projects have committed to incentivize collaboration between their users and BOLD users.&#x20;

You can learn more about the program in this [blog post](https://www.liquity.org/blog/bootstrapping-liquity-v2).

### Program Rules

All friendly forks are responsible for communicating the details and implementation of their commitments, as well as distributing any program rewards.

The following points apply to all friendly forks:

* Each friendly fork is required to audit any changes made to the Liquity V2 codebase in their specific deployment.&#x20;
* Each friendly fork is minting its own respective stablecoin, not BOLD.&#x20;
* Each friendly fork has the right to implement mutability as it sees fit.
* Liquity AG is not in an ongoing partnership with any licensing entity.&#x20;
